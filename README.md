Calculators are some of the simplest applications that come by default in every version of Windows. I have expanded them over time to support scientific and programmatic regimes, but at a fundamental level they are all the same.

We will implement a working standard calculator using the simple tkinter library. This will use three-part logic, including short stack, operator and state. Basic memory operations are also used!
